- 👋 Hi, I’m @jorgeoteroortiz !
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analysis, but mainly interested in Music Data. Yes, I'm the dude that won't shut up about how much he likes music. If I can do stuff with these two things combined, I'm as happy as a clam.
- 💼 Dream job? Probably, getting into customer personalization for any music streaming platform: new songs, old songs that you'd like, the 'Radar' thing...  (Spotify, hmu?). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SAS for database management in my current job. Hopefully, I'll get better with Python the more I try to convert my old projects from R to Python, and then upload them in here.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on so many things... I don't know how this sentence in other README files usually go. 
- 📫 How to reach me... Maybe post a comment or something? I'm kinda new to this.
